The left ankle injury occurred when he missed a step while walking downstairs, resulting in swelling, pain, and difficulty bearing weight on the foot. Mr. Wells expresses frustration with limited mobility and reliance on a cane for walking.",

The elbow pain is likely musculoskeletal in nature, possibly exacerbated by repetitive movements. The ankle injury appears to be a sprain or strain, requiring further imaging for a definitive diagnosis. Pain management and physical therapy will be essential components of his treatment plan to improve function and reduce discomfort.",
        "plan": "1. Prescribe pain medication for both the elbow and ankle injuries to alleviate discomfort.\n2. Schedule imaging studies (X-ray, MRI) to evaluate the extent of damage in the elbow and ankle.\n3. Refer Mr. Wells to physical therapy for rehabilitation and strengthening exercises.\n4. Follow up with blood work results and adjust treatment plan as needed.\n5. Educate Mr. Wells on home care measures, including rest, ice, compression, and elevation for the ankle injury.\n6. Coordinate with the care team to ensure continuity of care and support for Mr. Wells during his recovery process."
